# Processor
This project was part of a FPGA course at HUJI that I completed with Yosef Sokolik.
We were asked to implement a simple processor.
The processor had to execute the folowing commands:
1. Copy data from one register to another (Rx ← [Ry]).
2. Insert a number into a register (Rx ← D).
3. Add two registers (Rx ← [Rx] + [Ry]).
4. Substract one register from another (Rx ← [Rx] − [Ry]).
5. Count the number of ‘ones’ that are in a register (Ry ← number of ones [Rx]).

The full instructions for the processor are in a  file named “Lab#3_Processor_Specification”. The skeleton and the functions that were given to us are in a folder named “given modules”. I added the lab report in Hebrew that includes test simulations and explanation of the code we wrote.
