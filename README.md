# processor
This project was part of a FPGA course at huji that i completed with yosef sokolik.
We were asked to actualize a simple processor.
The processor had to execute the folowing commands:
1.  copy data from one register to another (Rx ← [Ry]).
2. insert a number into a register (Rx ← D).
3. add two registers (Rx ← [Rx] + [Ry]).
4. substract one register from another (Rx ← [Rx] − [Ry]).
5. count the number of ‘ones’ that are in a register (Ry ← number of ones [Rx]).

The full Instructions for the processor are in a  file named “Lab#3_Processor_Specification”.  the skeleton and the functions that were given to us are in a folder named “given modules”. And I added the lab report in Hebrew that includes  test simulations and explanation of the code we wrote.
